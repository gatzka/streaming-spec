# How to Model Complex Signals

This is a proposal how we might describe signals of any complexity.

Some techniques mentioned here are based on the HBM Streaming Protocol. 
Until we have a complete specification of the new streaming protocol,
[please refer here](https://github.com/HBM/streaming-spec/blob/master/streaming.md).

## Measured Data and Meta Information

HBM Streaming Protocol differentiates between meta information and measured data.
The meta information describes a stream or signal and tells how to interprete the measured data of a signal.

For both there is a header telling the signal id the measured data or meta information belongs to. If the data is related to the stream or device the signal id is 0.
In addition, this header contains length information. If the content is not understood, 
the parser can step to the next header and proceed with processing. This is usefull if the stream contains information, the client is not aware of.

### Stream Specific Meta Information

Everything concerning the whole device or the stream. Examples:

* Available Signals
* Device status information

### Signal Specific Meta Information

Everything describing the signal. Examples:

* Endianness of the binary data transferred.
* Signal name
* Signal unit information


\pagebreak

## Data Types

We support the following base value types:

* int8
* uint8
* int16
* uint16
* int32 
* uint32
* int64
* uint64
* real32
* real64
* complex32
* complex64
* time (a 64 bit quantity that contains an absolute time given a specific time family)

In addition we might have known value types that are combinations of those base value types.
There might be implicit knowledge about how to handle those known complex value types. If one is not able to handle a type, the underlying length information can be used to skip the package.
Currently there are no such value types.

The following section describe some compound data types, that be can made by combining base data types.

### Dimensions

A value consisting more than one scalar value can be described using several dimension.

All dimensions are described within an array. We use an array instead of 
an object to have a fixed order. 

Each dimension has its own value type.

### Spectrum Desribed with Dimensions

We use 2 dimensions. In addition we introduce the functiontype which helps the client to interprete the data.

~~~~ {.javascript}
{
  "name": "the spectrum",
  "functionType": "spectrum",
  "dataType": "dimensions",
  "dimensions": [
    {
      "comment": "domain axis",
      "name": "frequency",
      "dataType": "double",
      "unit": "Hz",
      "rule": "linear",
      "linear": {
        "delta": 10,
        "start": 100
      }
    },
    {
      "comment": "value dimension",
      "name": "sound pressure",
      "dataType": "double",
      "unit": "dB",
      "rule": "explicit"
    }
  ],
  "count": 100
}
~~~~

`dimensions[0]`: Frequency following an implicit rule.
`dimensions[1]`: The sound pressure with as explicit values

Only `dimensions[1]` is explicit, hence there are 100 double values to be transferred together with a time stamp.


### Spectrum As Complex Type

Spectral values over a range in the spectral domain. The spectral domain follows an implicit rule.

~~~~ {.javascript}
{
  "name": "spectrum name"
  "dataType": "spectrum",
  "spectrum" : {
    "value" : {
      "dataType" : "double",
      "unit" : <unit object>
    },
    "domain" : {
      "dataType" : "double",
      "unit" : <unit object>,
      "rule" : "linear",
      "linear" : {
		"delta": 10.0,
		"start" : 1000.0
      }
    },
    "count" : 100
  }  
}
~~~~

- `spectrum`: An object describing a spectrum
- `value`: Describing the spectral values (i.e. amplitude, attenuation)
- `domain`: Describing the range in the spectral domain (i.e. frequency)
- `count`: Number of points in the spectrum

Only `value` is explicit, hence there are 100 double values to be transferred together with a time stamp.

#### Generic Alternative

Here we combine array, struct and base types. There are no complex value types, only a combination of the mentioned types!

~~~~ {.javascript}
{
  "name": "spectrum name"
  "functionType": "spectrum",
  "dataType": "array",
  "array" : {
    "count" : 100,

        "rule" : "explicit"
      },
      "domain" : {

        "unit" : <unit object>,
        "rule" : "linear",
        "linear" : {
	      "delta": 10.0,
	      "start" : 1000.0
	    }
      }
    }
  }  
}
~~~~

- `functionType`: Depending on the type, the client expects a specified structure.
- `array/count`: The number of points in each spectrum
- `value`: Describes the measured values (i.e. amplitude, attenuation).
- `domain`: Describes the range in the spectral domain (i.e. frequency)

Only `value` is explicit, hence there are 100 double values to be transferred together with a time stamp.

### Histogram Desribed with Dimensions

We use 2 dimensions. In addition we introduce the functiontype which helps the client to interprete the data.

~~~~ {.javascript}
{
  "name": "the histogram",
  "functionType": "histogram",
  "dataType": "dimensions",
  "dimensions": [
    {
      "comment": "histogram classes",
      "name": "frequency",
      "dataType": "double",
      "unit": "Hz",
      "rule": "linear",
      "linear": {
        "delta": 10.0,
        "start": 100.0
      }      
    },
    {
      "comment": "class counters",
      "name": "count",
      "dataType": "uint64",
      "rule": "explicit"
    }
  ],
  "count": 50
}
~~~~

`dimensions[0]`: The histogram classes or bins over the frequency following an implicit rule.
`dimensions[1]`: The explicit class counter values

Only `dimensions[1]` is explicit, hence there are 50 uint64 values to be transferred together with a time stamp.


### Histogram As Complex Type {#Histogram}

This is an example of such a complex value type. It is used for statistics.

~~~~ {.javascript}
{
  "name": "histogram name"
  "dataType": "histogram",
  "histogram": {
    "classes": {
      "dataType": "uint64",
      "rule" : "linear",
      "linear" : {
		"delta": 1.0,
		"start": 50.0
	  }
      "count": 50,
    },
  },
}
~~~~

- `histogram`: An object describing the histogram
- `classes`: The distribution classes are desribed here. This equals very much the linear implicit axis rule!
- `classes/dataType`: Type of counter
- `classes/count`: Number of distributaion classes
- `classes/rule`: This histogram follows an implicit linear rule. Other rules are also possible.
- `classes/linear/delta`: Width of each distribution class
- `classes/linear/start`: First distribution class starts here



#### Generic Alternative

Here we combine array, struct and base types. There are no complex value types, only a combination of the mentioned types!

In addition there is a functiontype which helps the client to inteprete the data.

~~~~ {.javascript}
{
  "name": "a name"
  "functionType": "histogram",
  "dataType": "array",
  "array" : {
    "count" : 50,
    "dataType": "struct",
    "struct" {
      "count" : {
        "dataType" : "uint64",
        "rule" : "explicit"
      },
      "class" : {
        "dataType" : "uint32",
        "rule" : "linear",
        "linear" : {
	      "delta": 1.0,
	      "start" : 50.0
	    }
      }
    }
  }  
}
~~~~

- `functionType`: Depending on the type, the client expects a specified structure.
- `array/count`: The number of classes in each histogram
- `count`: Values of the counters
- `class`: The classes for counting

Only `count` is explicit, hence this is the data to be transferred.

## Implicit Rules

A value might follow a specific rule. We do not need to transfer each value, just some start information and the rule to calculate any other value that follows.
We use implicit rules to greatly reduce the amount of data to be transferred, stored and processed.

There are several kinds of rules. To calculate the absolute value , the rule has to be applied.

All implicit rules are described by a signal specific meta information.


### Linear Rule {#Linear_Rule}
For equidistant value we use the linear rule.

It is described by an absolute start value and a relative delta between two neighboring values. 

![Equidistant 2 dimensional points](images/equidistant_points.png)

There are cases, where the axis is an array of values with fixed length (i.e. the frequency of a spectrum). 
Here we add a value count. Each array of values start with the start value.

A linear axis is described as follows:

~~~~ {.javascript}
{
  "rule": "linear",
  "linear": {
    "start": <value>,
    "delta": <value>,
  },
}
~~~~

- `rule`: Type of implicit rule
- `linear`: Properties of the implicit linear rule
- `linear/start`: the first value
- `linear/delta`: The difference between two values


### constant Rule
The rule is simple: There is a start value. The value equals the start value until a new start value is posted.

~~~~ {.javascript}
{
  "rule": "constant",
  "constant": {
    "start": <value>,
  },
}
~~~~

\pagebreak

### cpb Rule


~~~~ {.javascript}
{
  "rule": "cpb"
  "cpb" {
    "basesystem": 10,
    "firstband": 2,
    "numberfractions": 3
  }
}
~~~~

- `rule`: Type of implicit rule
- `cpb`: Details for the rule of type cpb
- `cpb/basesystem` : logarithm base
- `cpb/firstband` : first band of the spectrum
- `cpb/numberfractions` : Number of fractions per octave



\pagebreak


## Explicit Rule
![2 dimensional points](images/non_equidistant_points.png)

When there is no implicit rule defined, each value has an absolute coordinate for this axis.
There is no rule how to calculate the absolute value. We call it an explicit rule.

~~~~ {.javascript}
{
  "rule": "explicit"
}
~~~~

Explicit rule does not have any further parameters.

\pagebreak


## Time 

The time is mandatory for each signal. It is not part of the signal value.
It can follow an implicit rule (most likely equidistant or linear) or may be explicit.


### Linear Time
Equidistant time is described as a [linear implicit rule](#Linear_Rule).
To calculate the absolute time for linear time, There needs to 
be an absolute start time and a delta time. 
Both can be delivered by a separate, signal specific, meta information. 

- The delta is mandatory.
- The absolute time always belongs to the next following value
- The device might deliver the absolute time before delivering the first value point.
- If the device does not possess a clock, there might be no absolute time at all.
- The device might deliver the absolute time whenever its clock is being set (resynchronization).
- It might deliver a new absolute time after a pause or any other abberation in the equidistant time


~~~~ {.javascript}
{
  "method": "time",
  "params": {
    "rule": "linear",
    "linear": {
      "start": <value>,
      "delta": <value>,
    },
    "unit": <unit object>,
    "dataType": <string>,
}
~~~~

- `method`: Type of meta information
- `rule`: type of axis
- `unit`: Unit of the axis
- `linear/start`: The absolute timestamp for the next value point.
- `linear/delta`: The time difference between two value points

### Explicit Time
Time is delivered as absolute time stamp for each value.

~~~~ {.javascript}
{
  "method": "time",
  "params": {
    "rule": "explicit",
    "unit": <unit object>,
    "dataType": "time"
  }
}
~~~~

- `method`: Type of meta information

\pagebreak


### How to Interprete Measured Data

After the meta information describing the signal has been received, delivered measured data blocks are to be interpreted as follows:

- See whether this is more meta information or measured data from a signal.
- Each data block contains all explicit values of a signal. 
- Non explicit Values are calculated according their rule (i.e. constant, linear).
- Theoretically a signal might contain no explicit value at all. There won't be any component value to be transferred. All component values are to calculated using their rules.
- A block may contain many values of this signal. They are arranged value by value.

\pagebreak


## Groups of Signals

There are cases were several signals are to be combined to a more complex group of signals (See [statistics example](#Statistics)).
Those groups are just describing signals that belong together.

To express the relation between the mentioned signals, the device will give a meta information about the grouping:

~~~~ {.javascript}
{
  "method": "signalGroups" {
    "params": {
      <signal group id>: {
        "name": "group_1"
        "signals": [ 
          < 1st signal id>,
          < 2nd signal id>,
          ...
        ],
      },
    },
  }
~~~~

- `<signal group id>`: A number with the groupt id, unique within the device
- `signals`: An arrays with the unique signal ids of all signals that belong to the group.

All signals in a group are in step, that is, they all have values for the same times.


## Examples

### A Voltage Sensor

The signal has 1 scalar value. Synchronous output rate is 100 Hz

- The voltage is expressed as a base value type
- The device delivers scaled component value in 32 bit float format
- The time is linear.

The device sends the following signal-specific meta information.


~~~~ {.javascript}
{
  "method": "signal",
  "params" : {
      "rule": "explicit",
      "dataType": "float",
      "unit": "V",
    ]
  }
}
~~~~

~~~~ {.javascript}
{
  "method": "time",
  "params" : {
    "rule": "linear",
    "linear": {
      "start": "high noon, 1st january 2019"
      "delta": "10 ms"
    },
    "dataType": "time"
  ]  
}
~~~~

Data block has the value of this signal encoded float. No time stamps.

### A CAN Decoder

The signal has a simple scalar value.

- The value is expressed as a base value type
- The value is explicit.
- The time is explicit.

The device sends the following signal-specific meta information:

~~~~ {.javascript}
{
  "method": "signal",
  "params" : {
    "name": "decoded",
    "rule": "explicit",       
    "dataType": "u32",
    "unit": "decoder unit"
  }
}
~~~~

~~~~ {.javascript}
{
  "method": "time",
  "params" : {
    "rule": "explicit",
    "dataType": "time"
  }
}
~~~~

Each value point has an absolute time stamp and one u32 value.

### A Simple Counter

This is for counting events that happens at any time (explicit rule).

- The value is expressed as a base value type
- The count value is linear with an increment of 2, it runs in one direction
- The device sends an initial absolute value.
- The time is explicit.

~~~~ {.javascript}
{
  "method": "signal",
  "params" : {
    "name": "count",
    "dataType": "u32",
    "rule" : "linear",
    "linear": {
      "delta": 2
    }     
  }
}
~~~~

~~~~ {.javascript}
{
  "method": "time",
  "params" : {
    "rule": "explicit",
  }  
}
~~~~


Value is linear with a step width of 2.
We get no start value of the value, hence we are starting with 0.

Data blocks will contain timestamps only. The counter changes by a known amount of 2.


### A incremental Rotary Incremental Encoder with start Position

- The value is expressed as a base value type
- The counter representing the angle follows a linear rule, it can go back and forth
- Absolute start position when crossing a start position. 
- No initial absolute value.
- The time is explicit.


~~~~ {.javascript}
{
  "method": "signal",
  "params" : {
    "rule": "linear",
    "linear": {
      "delta": 1,
    },
    "name": "counter",
    "dataType": "i32",
  }
}
~~~~

~~~~ {.javascript}
{
  "method": "time",
  "params" : {
    "rule": "explicit",
  }
}
~~~~



This is similar to the simple counter. Data blocks will contain timestamps only. 
The counter changes by a known amount of 1 only the time of the steps is variable.

We get a (partial) meta information with a start value of the counter every time when the zero index is being crossed:

~~~~ {.javascript}
{
  "method": "signal",
  "params" : {
    "linear" : {
      "start" : 0
    }
  }
}
~~~~

If the rotation direction changes, we get a (partial) meta information with a new delta for the linear rule:

~~~~ {.javascript}
{
  "method": "signal",
  "params" : {
    "linear" : {
      "delta": -1
    }      
  }
}
~~~~


### An Absolute Rotary Incremental Encoder

- The value is expressed as a base value type
- The angle is explicit, it can go back and forth
- The time is explicit.

~~~~ {.javascript}
{
  "method": "signal",
  "params" : {
    "rule": "explicit",
    "name": "counter",
    "dataType": "i32",
  }
}
~~~~

~~~~ {.javascript}
{
  "method": "time",
  "params" : {
    "rule": "explicit",
  }
}
~~~~

Data block will contain a tuple of counter and time stamp. There will be no meta ionformation when direction changes.


### An Optical Spectrum {#Optical_Spectrum}

The signal consists of a spectum

- The value is complex value type of type spectrum. This carries:
	* Frequency which is implicit linear, it has an absolute start value of 100.
	* Amplitude which is explicit
- The time is explicit. Each complete spectrum has one time stamp.


#### Signal Meta Information

##### Transferred Measured Data

Data block will contain an absolute time stamp followed by 1024 amplitude double values. There will be no frequency values because they are implicit.

### An Optical Spectrum with Peak Values

The signal consists of a spectum and the peak values. Number of peaks is fixed 16. 
If the number of peaks does change, there will be a meta information telling about the new amount of peaks!

Data block will contain:

- 1 absolute time stamp 
- 1024 spectrum amplitude double values. No spectrum frequncy values because those are implicit.
- 16 amplitude, frequency pairs.


### CPB Spectrum

A CPB (Constant Percentage Bandwidth) spectrum is a logarithmic frequency spectrum where the actual bands are defined by a standard (not exactly logarithmic).
The spectrum is defined by the following values:

- Number of fractions per octave (e.g. 3)
- Id of the first band of the spectrum.
- The logarithmic base of the spectrum (2 or 10)
- Number of bands

The time is explicit.

### Statistics {#Statistics}

Statistics consists of N "counters" each covering a value interval. If the measured value is within a counter interval, then that counter is incremented.
For instance the interval from 50 to 99 dB might be covered by 50 counters. Each of these counters then would cover 1 dB.

Often there also is a lower than lowest and higher than highest counter, and for performance reasons, there might be a total counter.


Example: 50 - 99 dB statistics:
It is made up of a struct containing an [complex value type histogram](#Histogram) with 50 classes (bins) and three additional counters for the lower than, higher than and total count.

### Spectral Statistics

Spectral statistics is a swarm of statistics over an additional axis.
This axis could for instance be a CPB axis, for each CPB band there is a statistic.

Example: 50 - 99 dB spectral statistics on a 1/3 octave CPB:


This is made up from an array of structs containing a histogram, lower than counter, higher than counter and a frequency

### Harmonic Analysis

Matthias: I'm not sure whether I understood the structure correctly. This needs to be clarified.

The result delivered from harmonic analysis done by HBM Genesis/Perception is fairly complex.
One combined value consists of the following:
- a scalar value distortion
- a scalar value fundamental frequency
- an array of ffts each one belonging to the harmonixc frequencies.

Here we define a complex type that is made up struct with some base types and an array of 10 spectras.

We'll get the following signal specific meta information:

~~~~ {.javascript}
{
  "name": "spectral statistics",
  "dataType": "struct",
  "struct" : {
    "distortion" : < double >,
    "fundamental frquency" : < double >
    "harmonics" : {
      "dataType: "array",
      "array" : {
        "count": 10,
        "dataType": "struct",
        "struct" : {
          "frequency" : {
            "dataType": "double"
          },
          "fft" : {          
            "dataType": "spectrum",
            "spectrum" : {
              "count" : 360,
              "value" : {
                "dataType" : "double",

  		          "start" : 0
                }
              }
            }          
          }          
        }
